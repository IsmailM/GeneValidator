  approach: We expect the query sequence to be similar to the top ten BLAST hits.
    Here, we create a statistical consensus model of those top hits and compare the

  explanation: The query sequence includes 46% amino-acid residues present in the

    profile.  23% of residues in the consensus profile are absent from the query sequence.
  conclusion: These results suggest that there may be some problems with the query
    sequence. The query sequence has a high percentage (38%) of extra residues absent
    from the statistical profile (the cut-off is 20%). The query sequence has a high
    percentage (23%) of missing residues when compared to the statistical profile

  approach: We expect each BLAST hit to match each region of the query at most once.
    Here, we calculate the distribution of hit coverage against the query sequence
    and use the Wilcoxon test to determine if it is higher than 1.
  explanation: The Wilcoxon test produced a p-value of 1.
  conclusion: This suggests that the query sequence contains no erroneous duplications.

  explanation: The distribution of start and/or end-coordinates of HSPs are multi-modal.
    To detect potential problems we performed a linear regression (with coordinates
    weighted inversely proportionally to  hit strength). The resulting slope is -0.04.

  approach: We expect the query sequence to encode a single protein-coding gene. Here,
    we analyse the High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs) identified by BLAST to determine
    whether the query includes sequence from two or more genes.
  explanation: The distribution of start and/or end-coordinates of HSPs are multi-modal.
    To detect potential problems we performed a linear regression (with coordinates
    weighted inversely proportionally to  hit strength). The resulting slope is -0.0.
  conclusion: This slope is  outside our empirically calculated thresholds (0.4 and
    1.2). There is no evidence that the query contains sequence from multiple genes.

  approach: We expect the query sequence to be similar to the top ten BLAST hits.

  explanation: The query sequence includes 40% amino-acid residues present in the

    profile.  61% of residues in the consensus profile are absent from the query sequence.
  conclusion: These results suggest that there may be some problems with the query

  pvalue: 1
  threshold: 0.05
  result: :yes

  average: 1.0
  approach: We expect each BLAST hit to match each region of the query at most once.
    Here, we calculate the distribution of hit coverage against the query sequence
    and use the Wilcoxon test to determine if it is higher than 1.
  explanation: The Wilcoxon test produced a p-value of 1.
  conclusion: This suggests that the query sequence contains no erroneous duplications.

  approach: We expect the query sequence to encode a single gene, thus it should contain

    within this ORF.
  explanation: 'BLAST identified 279 High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs): 278 HSPs align

  explanation: The distribution of start and/or end-coordinates of HSPs are multi-modal.
    To detect potential problems we performed a linear regression (with coordinates
    weighted inversely proportionally to  hit strength). The resulting slope is -0.04.

    1.2). There is no evidence that the query contains sequence from multiple genes.

  approach: We expect the query sequence to be similar to the top ten BLAST hits.
    Here, we create a statistical consensus model of those top hits and compare the
    query to this  model.
  explanation: The query sequence includes 81% amino-acid residues present in the
    consensus model. 36% of residues in the query sequence are absent from the consensus
    profile.  3% of residues in the consensus profile are absent from the query sequence.
  conclusion: These results suggest that there may be some problems with the query

    from the statistical profile (the cut-off is 20%).

  approach: We expect the query sequence to encode a single protein-coding gene. Here,
    we analyse the High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs) identified by BLAST to determine
    whether the query includes sequence from two or more genes.
  explanation: The start coordinates and the end coordinates of HSPs are unimodally
    distributed.
  conclusion: This suggest that the query sequence represents a single gene.

  threshold: 0.05
  result: :no
  expected: :no
  average: 1.4600000000000002
  approach: We expect each BLAST hit to match each region of the query at most once.
    Here, we calculate the distribution of hit coverage against the query sequence
    and use the Wilcoxon test to determine if it is higher than 1.
  explanation: The Wilcoxon test produced a p-value of 0.002 (average = 1.46).
  conclusion: The null hypothesis is rejected - thus a region of the query sequence
    is likely repeated more than once.

  exp_msg: '200 HSPs align in frame 1; 200 HSPs align in frame 3; '
  totalHSP: 400
  approach: We expect the query sequence to encode a single gene, thus it should contain
    one main Open Reading Frame (ORF). All all BLAST hits are thus expected to align
    within this ORF.
  explanation: 'BLAST identified 400 High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs): 200 HSPs align
    in frame 1; 200 HSPs align in frame 3; .'
  conclusion: The HSPs align in mulitple reading frames, this suggests there may be
    a frame shift in the query sequence.

  approach: We expect the query sequence to encode a single gene, thus it should contain
    one main Open Reading Frame (ORF) that occupies most of the query sequence.
  explanation: " The longest ORF is in frame 1, where it  occupies 48% of the query
    sequence."
  conclusion: This only represents a portion of the query sequence. In some cases
    this indicates that a frame shift exists in the query sequence.

  approach: We expect the query sequence to be similar to the top ten BLAST hits.
    Here, we create a statistical consensus model of those top hits and compare the
    query to this  model.
  explanation: The query sequence includes 93% amino-acid residues present in the
    consensus model. 47% of residues in the query sequence are absent from the consensus
    profile.  1% of residues in the consensus profile are absent from the query sequence.
  conclusion: These results suggest that there may be some problems with the query
    sequence. The query sequence has a high percentage (47%) of extra residues absent
    from the statistical profile (the cut-off is 20%).
