  explainpart: is longer than sequences within
  explanation: If the query sequence is well conserved and database sequences are
    correct, we would expect the query and hit sequences to have similar lengths.  The
    length of the query sequence is 108 amino-acid residues. The most dense cluster
    of hit sequences includes lengths between 50 and 89 amino-acid residues. Thus
    the query sequence is longer than sequences within the most dense cluster of hits.

  explanation: If the query sequence is well conserved and database sequences are
    correct, we would expect the query and hit sequences to have similar lengths.  Here,
    BLAST produced 129 hits(s), where the median sequence length is 108.0 base pairs.
    The prediction has a length of 108 base pairs. There are 59 hit(s) that have sequence
    length that is further away from the median compared to the prediction. The rank
    of the prediction length lies within 9% of all BLAST hits.

    gene at most once. The result here suggests that the average coverage of hit regions
    is less than 1. This suggests that each region of each homologous hit matches
    the predicted gene at most once.

  explanation: If the query sequence is well conserved and database sequences are
    correct, we would expect the query and hit sequences to have similar lengths.  The
    length of the query sequence is 1023 amino-acid residues. The most dense cluster
    of hit sequences includes lengths between 708 and 724 amino-acid residues. Thus
    the query sequence is longer than sequences within the most dense cluster of hits.

  explanation: 'A position specific scoring matrix of the strongest 10 results show
    that: 35% of residues in the prediction do not appear in profile; 6% of residues
    in the profile do not appear in the prediction and when compared to the model,
    73% of residues are conserved in the prediciton.'
