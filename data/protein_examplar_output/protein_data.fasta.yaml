    hits) are correct, we can expect query and hit sequences to have similar lengths.
    Here, we cluster the lengths of hit sequences and compare the length of our query

  explanation: The most dense length-cluster of BLAST hits includes sequences that
    are from 186 to 300 amino-acids long. The query sequence is 554 amino-acids long
    and is thus outside the most dense length-cluster of BLAST hits.

  approach: We expect the query sequence to encode a single protein-coding gene. Here,
    we analyse the High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs) identified by BLAST to determine
    whether the query includes sequence from two or more genes.
  explanation: The distribution of start and/or end-coordinates of HSPs are multi-modal.
    To detect potential problems we performed a linear regression (with coordinates
    weighted inversely proportionally to  hit strength). The resulting slope is -0.18.
  conclusion: This slope is  outside our empirically calculated thresholds (0.4 and
    1.2). There is no evidence that the query contains sequence from multiple genes.

  explanation: The most dense length-cluster of BLAST hits includes sequences that

  approach: We expect the query sequence to be similar to the top ten BLAST hits.
    Here, we create a statistical consensus model of those top hits and compare the
    query to this  model.
  explanation: The query sequence includes 78% amino-acid residues present in the
    consensus model. 0% of residues in the query sequence are absent from the consensus
    profile.  21% of residues in the consensus profile are absent from the query sequence.
  conclusion: These results suggest that there may be some problems with the query
    sequence. The query sequence has a high percentage (21%) of missing residues when
    compared to the statistical profile (the cut-off is 20%).

  approach: We expect the query sequence to encode a single protein-coding gene. Here,
    we analyse the High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs) identified by BLAST to determine
    whether the query includes sequence from two or more genes.
  explanation: The distribution of start and/or end-coordinates of HSPs are multi-modal.
    To detect potential problems we performed a linear regression (with coordinates
    weighted inversely proportionally to  hit strength). The resulting slope is -0.14.
  conclusion: This slope is  outside our empirically calculated thresholds (0.4 and
    1.2). There is no evidence that the query contains sequence from multiple genes.

  explanation: The Wilcoxon test produced a p-value of 0.002 (average = 1.31).
  conclusion: The null hypothesis is rejected - thus a region of the query sequence
    is likely repeated more than once.

  approach: We expect the query sequence to be similar to the top ten BLAST hits.
    Here, we create a statistical consensus model of those top hits and compare the
    query to this  model.
  explanation: The query sequence includes 98% amino-acid residues present in the
    consensus model. 5% of residues in the query sequence are absent from the consensus
    profile.  14% of residues in the consensus profile are absent from the query sequence.
  conclusion: There is no evidence based on the top 10 BLAST hits to suggest any problems
    with the query sequence.

  explanation: The most dense length-cluster of BLAST hits includes sequences that
