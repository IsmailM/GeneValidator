  explanation: If the query sequence is well conserved and database sequences are
    correct, we would expect the query and hit sequences to have similar lengths.  The
    length of the query sequence is 1070 amino-acid residues. The most dense cluster
    of hit sequences includes lengths between 694 and 810 amino-acid residues. Thus
